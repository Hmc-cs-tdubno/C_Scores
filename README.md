# C_Scores

![The poster created for this app](https://github.com/Hmc-cs-tdubno/C_Scores/blob/views/Poster.png "The poster created for this app")

This app aims to make use of data gained from the Parker Team Player Survey, an survey on teamwork style. It acheives this in two ways. One, by allowing the user to upload datasets consisting of results from the survey and displaying these in helpful, visual ways. In addition, it uses data from teams who have completed a survey desinged by our team to measure success as well as the PTPS, and assigns measures of success to a hypothetical team inputted by the user. 

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/Hmc-cs-tdubno/C_Scores/blob/views/Capture.PNG "")

This app uses a standard MVC architecture as shown above. Technologies of note include Ruby on Rails as the base, an
SQLite database, gems such as Devise (for users) and Boostrap (for styling), the javascript library D3 to generate graphs, 
and calls to a python script for prediction.
